----------------------      D\W  Mutable and Immutable        --------------------------


Immutable means when you assign or give the refrence of  a value to the the varibale and then after you cannot change the value of the variable but you can change its refrence to another value in the memory but can't change the value 

 name = "rajeev" 
 name = ' vashist' 
 here you are changing the refrence of the name to rajeev to vashist you cannot change in rajeev or in vashist 

 but like the data type list , etc are mutable .. so you can change its value without changing its reference  

 eg.  my_list = [ 1,2,3,4,5]

 my_list[2] = 88
